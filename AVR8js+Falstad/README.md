# ThreeFalstad

## Introduction

ThreeFalstad is a simulator combining circuit simulation (provided by CircuitJS1) and physics simulation (provided by Three.js and Ammo.js). 

ThreeFalstad is currently being developed by Mark Megarry (mmegarry1@gmail.com) with a great amount of support from John Bustard, Matthew Reaney, Sam Ross and Joseph Stevenson.


## Building
***TODO***

## Running
To run ThreeFalstad, run /war/circuitjs.html.  By default, the circuit loaded will be /war/circuitjs1/circuits/MotorSim.txt and the physics simulation loaded will be /war/js/MotorSim.js
