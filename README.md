# QLAB-Robotics-Simulation
A repo to document the development of QLAB's robotics simulator based on CircuitJS1 (https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1), Ammo.js (https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) and Three.js (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

## ThreeFalstad
ThreeFalstad is a JavaScript-based simulator which combines the electrical simulation of CircuitJS1 with the physics simulation of Three.js and Ammo.js.  For more information, see /ThreeFalstad/README.md.
