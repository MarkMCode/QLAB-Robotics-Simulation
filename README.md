# QLAB-Robotics-Simulation
A repo to document the development of QLAB's robotics simulator incorporating CircuitJS1 (https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1), Ammo.js (https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) and Three.js (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

## ThreeFalstad
ThreeFalstad is a JavaScript-based simulator which combines the electrical simulation of CircuitJS1 with the physics simulation of Three.js and Ammo.js.  For more information, see /ThreeFalstad/README.md.

***Try the proof-of-concept DC motor simulation at https://markmegarry.github.io/QLAB-Robotics-Simulation/***

- Press the "Start physics sim" button and slide the voltage slider to vary the voltage applied to the motor

- Use the arrow keys and +/- to move the camera, use WASD to pan the camera
